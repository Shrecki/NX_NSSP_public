In an event related design, each task is presented individually for a short amount of time e.g., 3 seconds.

Conversely, in a block-related design, blocks of tasks, each lasting at least 10 seconds, recur before intervals of rest. \n",

On the other hand, event-related designs reduce the effects of learning, boredom while exhibiting loss in detection power. "

You can see the corresponding peaks in the PSD above. Based on this, the upper pass-band edge of your low pass filter can be set to 0.2Hz. You can use transbandwidth to make a smooth transition between the passband (0.2Hz) and the stopband (0.3Hz, frequency above which you will get your signal contaminated by physiological oscillations).
