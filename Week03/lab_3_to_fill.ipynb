The first that comes to mind is that if you overlay your fMRI on the anatomy, you can of course reason much more easily on where you are in the brain, what activations you might be looking at and so forth. Imagine a participant has a brain lesion visible on the anatomy and you want to see how this reflects on the fMRI. Being able to put the two together would make it much easier, would it not?\n",
