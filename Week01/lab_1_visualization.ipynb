While a full discourse on the format itself is a bit out of scope for this exercise, there are several things one should be aware of:\n",
    "- A NIfTI file under the hood comprises two things, a header, and an image. The header keeps informations on the acquisition, such as dimensions of the voxels used, number of slices for each dimension, TR, affine transformation, sequence parameters...Some scanners (specifically SIEMENS scanners) will also store in the header information about the timing acquisitions of each slice, which is particularly handy when you need to perform slice-timing correction. The image itself is the data that has been acquired: the 3D volume in the case of a structural MR image!\n",
