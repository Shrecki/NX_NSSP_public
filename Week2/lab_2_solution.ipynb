    "As an example, we will teach you how to put your subjects in a common space, the MNI space through a step of <b>normalization</b> (more on that later!), such that subjects can be compared at the group-level. Assume now that for the purpose of your analysis, you are interested only in a single subject, or that the method of choice should be at an individual level for your application. Clearly the normalization is superfluous in this case.\n",

High motion tends to cause non linear effects in the signal that simple motion correction above cannot correct since it has no awareness of the magnetic field. <br>\n",
    "<br> Motion parameters can, in this case, come to our rescue. As they represent the effect of motion, including them in our modeling to try and correct the signal can help.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coregistration\n",
    "\n",
    "Just what is coregistration? Well, it is basically a registration between images of different modalities. In our specific case, we want to register fMRI (EPI) to an anatomical image (T1). There are several reasons for this. The first that comes to mind is that if you overlay your fMRI on the anatomy, you can of course reason much more easily on where you are in the brain, what activations you might be looking at and so forth. Imagine a participant has a brain lesion visible on the anatomy and you want to see how this reflects on the fMRI. Being able to put the two together would make it much easier, would it not?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first reason behind coregistration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is because of normalization. Assume you want to compare all fMRI data of participants. Clearly, putting all of them into a common reference frame is a bit trickier, because of how noisy and low-resolution the data is, right? But you know how to map the anatomical to this common space with excellent accuracy, and you've saved this transformation earlier.\n",
    "If you could figure out how to go from the fMRI space to anatomical, clearly the problem would be solved! You'd only have then to apply the transformation from anatomical to common space and be done with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the fMRI space to anatomical transformation is precisely the goal of coregistration.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To do this step, we will use a wonderful command: <a href=\"https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT/UserGuide#epi_reg\">epi_reg</a> ! As the name states, it is a command to register an EPI. Hard to make it clearer huh? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to do\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we want to compute the transformation to use for coregistration.\n",
    "Now, we have an EPI, here of 364 volumes, each supposedly aligned by motion-correction. How many times should we compute the transformation?\n",
    "- [ ] 364 times, once for each volume\n",
    "- [ ] Once, selecting any volume from the EPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is simple. You should:\n",
    "- Fill in the name of the EPI target. It should be the **motion-corrected** EPI that you corrected using MCFLIRT (ignore the slice-timing corrected volume). If you want to use a single volume, set the use_first_vol variable to True!\n",
    "- Fill in the path to the whole head T1 image (**before** skull stripping was conducted!)\n",
    "- Fill in the path to the skull-stripped T1 image (**after** skull stripping was conducted!)"
